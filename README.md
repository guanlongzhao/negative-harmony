# Negative Harmony through Signal Processing
Can we automatically create the [negative harmony](http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VIII/2018/Special%20Issue/01_Balan.pdf) [1] version of a piece of music through signal processing?

This is a personal project that I plan to work on in my spare time after I defend my Ph.D. dissertation. Stay tuned...
